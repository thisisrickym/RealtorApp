*** Two extra things. First when I import my zip file to the computers at school, it fails until I do the following from
 the eclipse window.
Windows -> Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Errors/Warnings -> 
Deprecated and restricted API -> Forbidden reference (access rules): -> change to warning

I'm not sure why it doesn't want you to have access to javafx and this kind of freaked me out because I've only been working
on my own computer. It didn't have this problem.

Second thing, is when I open my zipped file after doing the above and click run as application, it opens up an eclipse
box with the title "Select Java Application". The list contains all HSQLDB files except for the one I want to run, which
is MainMenu.

If you could click this and click ok, everything should go fine. I couldn't figure out how to get it to ignore all of the
HSQLDB things, and I'm running out of time.

Thanks
